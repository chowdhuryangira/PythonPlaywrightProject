# Python Playwright Project
This project is a Python-based automation framework using Playwright, designed to facilitate web testing and interaction. It employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance code organization and maintainability.
# Features
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organizes page interactions into separate classes for better maintainability.
- **Fixtures**: Utilizes Playwright's fixtures for setup and teardown of browser contexts.
- **Test Cases**: Contains example test cases demonstrating how to use the framework.
- **Configuration**: Uses a configuration file for easy customization of browser settings and test parameters.
- **Logging**: Implements logging for better debugging and traceability of test execution.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions during test execution.
- **Assertions**: Provides a set of assertions to validate test outcomes.
- **Documentation**: Well-documented code with comments and a README file for easy understanding and usage.
- **Reporting**: Generates test reports to summarize test results and execution details.
